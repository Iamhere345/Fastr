# Installation

## Download
Download Fastr using any of these links. I am currently working on a way to install Fastr using rojo

### Method 1: Roblox Model
download either of these models and add them to your roblox game. (note: the loader version does not include the source code of Fastr, instead it requires Fastr (it can be configured to require the stable, unstable and experimental versions of Fastr). The Source version comes with all of Fastr's source code, which means you can modify it to your liking, but it won't automatically update.)

- [Source version](https://www.roblox.com/library/7768369303/)
- [Loader version](https://www.roblox.com/library/7981503602/)

### Method 2: Github Releases:
click on [this link](https://github.com/Iamhere345/Fastr/releases) to open the releases page of Fastr and download the version of Fastr you would like.

### Method 3: Rojo
 - download the github repository (for cli users `git clone https://github.com/Iamhere345/Fastr.git`)
 - Open your roblox place
 - `rojo serve` the repo and use the rojo plugin to sync it into your roblox place.
