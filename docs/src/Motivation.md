# Motivation

When developing games, you should be able to do things that a typical player can't do without using the developer console. Many administration systems exist for Roblox, but most of them have the same problem: they're full of bloatware. Some admin systems (notably HD Admin) have commands meant for fun, not development, which takes up space and ultimately becomes slow in games with a lot of stuff in them. Another problem with these admin systems is that they're hard to extend. Many of them provide an extension framework, but they're quite limited in their capabilities. Fastr was designed to do what these admin systems won't: provide a small, extendable admin system that developers can use in their games.
