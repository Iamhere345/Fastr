# Introduction

Fastr is a lightweight administration system. It comes with most commands that you would need pre-installed (ban, fly, kick, etc.), but is meant to be extended by other people. Fastr does not come with any bloatware (such as "fun" commands that serve no purpose other than for users to mess around with).
